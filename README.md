Framer is a next-generation design tool that empowers designers to build fully interactive prototypes with realistic animations, transitions, and user flows. It stands out with its code-based components, allowing for greater flexibility and realism in prototype behavior.

Unlike traditional design tools, Framer integrates design and development workflows seamlessly. It supports real-time collaboration, making it easy for teams to work together from anywhere. The platform also includes a built-in publishing system, so you can share your prototypes with stakeholders instantly.

Framer is built for performance and works flawlessly on modern Mac hardware, including M-series chips. It is optimized for macOS and takes full advantage of Apple's Retina displays for crisp, clear visuals.

Whether you're designing a simple landing page or a complex application, Framer provides the tools to prototype, test, and iterate quickly. Its component-based system ensures consistency and speeds up the design process.
